Steps to sync sahana tables(Shelter Info) in 2 different Sahana installations (named as Local and Remote) using Mesh4x technologies.


= Method 1: mysql-to-mysql =

*Prerequisites*:
  * Install JDK (Version 1.5 or later) <br>
  * Install Mesh4x *EktooClient* ([http://code.google.com/p/mesh4x/wiki/HowToUseEktooClient  Ektoo Client]).


*Steps*: 

  * 1. Allow remote mysql database access of Sahana instance from the machine where Ektoo Client will be executed.

  * 2. Log in as 'admin' in local Sahana instance.

  * 3. Add 3 Shelter Info (named as GSL, GKL, GKS) using [Sahana Main (local)]/Shelter Registry>Add shelter.

  * 4. Go to [Sahana Main (local)]/Shelter Registry>View all shelters. This will show 3 Records (named as GSL, GKL, GKS).

  * Mesh4x FeedSync Server installed, running and accessible via http from the machine where Ektoo Client will be executed.

Following are the high level steps to accomplish that:

  * 1.	Login to local Sahana instance add Shelter info.
